Gas leak detection is the process of identifying potentially hazardous gas leaks by sensors. These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected. Exposure to toxic gases can also occur in operations such as painting, fumigation, fuel filling, construction, excavation of contaminated soils, landfill operations, entering confined spaces, etc.

Gas leakage is sensed using MQ-2 sensor, when it is more than threshold value given which is interfaced by Arduino UNO. The buzzer will be on to notify the surrounding people. Using the relay on, the power supply will be off and then there will a display on the LCD for detection of the alert message like LPG gas detected!.
